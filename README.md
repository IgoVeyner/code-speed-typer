# Code Speed Typer 
[![Site preview](frontend/assets/typing.gif)](https://code-race.netlify.app/)

Given a line of code how fast can you type it? Did you make any mistakes? Did you have to look down at your keyboard to look for that pesky pipe character? 

This app spits a random line of code on your screen and its your job to type it. It'll track how long it takes you to complete it and the number of mistakes you make. Practice with your friends on the same computer by refreshing the page and logging in with a different username. GLHF!
